A simple python3 script to quickly scan subnets for active SSH or VNC servers.

You may specify specific IPs and CIDR subnets on the command line, otherwise
sscan will try various techniques to identify locally connected subnets and
scan those.

Examples:

    $ ./sscan
    Scanning 192.168.0.0/23 for SSH servers...
      192.168.0.5     : SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_7.4p1 Debian-10+deb9u7
      192.168.0.3     : SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_7.6
      192.168.1.143   : SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_7.9p1 Raspbian-10+deb10u2
    3 servers found

    $ ./sscan -v 10.0.0.0/18 192.168.0.5
    Scanning 10.0.0.0/18, 192.168.0.5 for VNC servers...
    Warning, scanning 16385 hosts may take over 1 minute!
      192.168.0.5     : RFB 003.008

The nominal scan rate is 256 hosts per second, a warning is printed if the
projected scan time exceeds one minute.

Responding IPs are printed to stdout, all other messages go to stderr.

Exit status 0 if at least one host is identified, or 1 if no hosts (or an error).

Tested on Linux and Windows, also should work with python2.
