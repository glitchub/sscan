Quickly scan subnets for active SSH, VNC, and other TCP servers.

Usage:

    sscan [options] [subnet [... subnet]]

Options:

    -b mS   - milliseconds to wait for banner text, 0 to disable (default 2000)
    -c mS   - milliseconds to wait for server connect (default 250)
    -h      - show this text
    -n N    - number of concurrent server connections (default 64)
    -p port - TCP port to scan (default 22)
    -v      - alias for '-p5900', search for VNC servers instead of SSH

Subnets are specified in CIDR format "IP/prefix" (if "/prefix" is not specified
then defaults to "/32", i.e. just scan that one IP address).

If no subnets are specified, sscan will attempt to determine locally attached
subnets and scan those.

Responding IPs are printed to stdout, followed by the first line of banner text
(unless -b0 was specified). All other messages go to stderr.

Exit status is 0 if at least one host responded to the scan.

Examples:

    $ ./sscan

    $ ./sscan -v 10.0.0.0/18 192.168.0.5
