Usage:

    sscan [options] [address[/prefix] [... address[/prefix]]

Quickly scan subnets for active SSH, VNC, and other TCP servers.

Options are:

    -b mS   - milliseconds to wait for banner text, 0 to disable (default 1000)
    -c mS   - milliseconds to wait for server connect (default 200)
    -e      - show estimated scan time (default, show only if scan will exceed 1 minute)
    -h      - show this text
    -n N    - number of concurrent server connections (default 64)
    -p port - TCP port to scan (default 22)
    -v      - alias for '-p5900', search for VNC servers instead of SSH

Subnets are specified in CIDR format "address/prefix". The "/prefix" is
optional, if not specified then the default is "/32" (i.e. just scan that one
IP address).

If no subnets are specified, sscan will attempt to determine locally attached
subnets and scan those.

If some hosts are not detected or intermittently detected, try increasing the
server connect timeout.

If strange networking errors occur, or the program complains about too many
open file handles, try reducing the number of concurrent connections.

The overall scan time can by *significantly* reduced by decreasing the server
connect timeout and/or increasing the number of concurrent connections, but
note this may provoke the issues described above.

Exit status is 0 if at least one host responded to the scan.

Responding IPs are printed to stdout, followed by the first line of header text
(unless -h0 was specified). All other messages go to stderr.

Tested on Linux and Windows, also should work with python2.

    $ ./sscan
